## ❓ Troubleshooting

**Q: Text doesn't auto-resize properly**
- Make sure "Auto-resize to fit" is enabled on text box
- Set min/max font sizes (e.g., 24pt min, 72pt max)
- Add more padding around text (100px from edges)

**Q: Bulk Create doesn't show all designs**
- Check CSV formatting (no extra commas, proper headers)
- Max 50 rows per bulk create (you have 40, so OK)
- Try uploading CSV as Google Sheet instead

**Q: Can't schedule to Instagram**
- Make sure you're using Instagram Business account (not personal)
- Reconnect Instagram in Canva settings
- Check Instagram permissions

**Q: Hashtags get cut off in caption**
- Keep hashtags under 30 total
- Break into multiple lines for readability
- Use 10-15 most relevant hashtags only
