## ‚è∏Ô∏è PAUSE HERE - Manual Task Required

### You Need To: Create the Social Media Expert Agent

**Steps:**
1. Go to your Claude agent creation interface
2. Create a new agent called **"Social Media Expert"**
3. Copy the contents from: `/.agents/agent-prompts/social-media-expert.md`
4. Paste into the agent's system prompt
5. Save/activate the agent

**Why This Can't Be Automated:**
The agent creation process is a manual UI action in your Claude interface. Once you've created the agent, you can then invoke it programmatically for content generation.
