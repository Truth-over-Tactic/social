## 📂 Repository Structure

├── README.md
└── images/
    └── scheduled/
        ├── 10312025/          # Live batch: Oct 31 - Nov 19, 2025 (57 posts)

```

## 🎯 Purpose

This public repository serves as the **image hosting CDN** for scheduled social media posts across:
- Instagram (@truthovertactic)
- Facebook
- Twitter/X
- Pinterest
- LinkedIn

Images are referenced via raw GitHub URLs in scheduling tools (Publer, Buffer, etc.).

## 📋 Documentation & Workflows

**All documentation, CSV files, and workflows live in the main project repository:**

📍 `/Volumes/Development/narcissist-book/@docs/social-media/`

Including:
- Multi-platform strategy guides
- Canva workflow documentation
- Publer CSV templates and scheduling guides
- Platform-specific specifications
- Quick start implementation guides

## 🚫 What's NOT Here

This repo intentionally excludes:
- ❌ CSV files (contain captions, hashtags - kept in main project)
- ❌ Strategy documentation (in main project @docs)
- ❌ Python scripts and automation tools (in main project)
- ❌ Reference materials and working files (in main project)

**Why?**
- Keeps public repo clean and focused
- Protects content strategy from being copied
- Separates public assets (images) from private workflow (documentation)

## 🔗 Related Repositories

- **Main Project**: `narcissist-book` (private)
- **This Repo**: `Truth-over-Tactic/social` (public)
- **Symlink**: `/Volumes/Development/narcissist-book/social` → `/Volumes/Development/truth-social`

## 📸 Image Standards

- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Branding**: "Truth Over Tactic" watermark on all graphics
- **Style**: Clean, professional, trauma-informed design
- **Colors**: Deep Teal, Sage Green, Warm Gold, Soft Cream, Charcoal

## 🔐 Important Notes

### Do NOT Delete Active Images
The `images/scheduled/10312025/` directory contains images currently referenced in **live scheduled posts**. While Publer likely caches images after import, maintain these files until posts have published (through Nov 19, 2025) to ensure reliability.

### Future Batches
Future date directories can be safely restructured before import, but once a CSV is imported to Publer with GitHub URLs, those images should remain accessible.
